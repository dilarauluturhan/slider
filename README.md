## About The Project
![](https://github.com/dilarauluturhan/slider/assets/120499369/d52637cb-60c4-4d9b-8522-0740164e4d78)

## Features
I aimed to make a picture slider in this project. I updated the current page number using useState() and useEffect() in the project and added a timer using the setInterval() function to change images automatically. The user can also change the page manually by clicking the arrow keys.

## Design
In this project, I used Pure CSS for the design.

## Built With
I created this project using the React and React Icons.
